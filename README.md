## General Info
This project is an idle automation game about a dice factory. Play consists of
designing and constructing a factory floor, shipping dice to a warehouse to be 
sold, and reinvesting the revenue into the business.

The original intent behind the project is for the developer to build confidence 
working with the Go programming language. 

## Technologies
This project is created with:
  * Go: v1.19
  * Ebitengine: v2.4.15
  
## Installation
To run this project, download as a .zip file, extract the contents into a 
local folder, and run dice-factory.exe

## Usage
To play, drag and drop objects around to produce dice and load them onto 
the truck. Objects can also be rotated by pressing 'r' while the cursor is
hovering over them. Once the dice are loaded, click the truck to ship the 
dice off to be sold. While adding objects, note conveyor belts are required
to extract dice from objects and load dice onto objects.

You can also see most information in the top left corner such as currencies, 
dice counts, truck capacity, and object costs. As you buy more objects, the
costs of those objects will go up exponentially.
